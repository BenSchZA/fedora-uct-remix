# fedora-uct-remix
Fedora Linux distribution remixed for UCT engineering students. 

It is a live image and must be written to a USB or CD/DVD using any of a number of available software options.
eg. http://www.linuxliveusb.com/ for Windows or https://fedorahosted.org/liveusb-creator/ for Linux.

The remix was created using the kickstart process, a good article explaing how to do this is here:
