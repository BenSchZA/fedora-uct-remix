# fedora-uct-remix
Fedora Linux distribution remixed for UCT engineering students. 

![live-iso-screenshot](screenshot.png)

It is a live image and must be written to a USB or CD/DVD using any of a number of available software options.

eg. http://www.linuxliveusb.com/ for Windows or https://fedorahosted.org/liveusb-creator/ for Linux.

The remix was created using the kickstart process, a good article explaing how to do this is here:

https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_create_and_use_a_Live_CD

I have included the torrent file (which may or may not work... or you can dowload the .ks file and create the ISO on a Fedora linux system). 

Some changes will need to be made to the .ks file, but the basics are there. The included install files will need to be downloaded and put in the correct directory.

The default Fedora Workstation distribution can be downloaded from here: https://getfedora.org/
